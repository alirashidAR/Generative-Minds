# FloorPlanGAN

FloorPlanGAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate 2D floor plans based on user preferences. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns from real-world architectural layouts to produce realistic and customizable floor plans tailored to specified criteria. 

## Features
- **User-Centric Design:** Allows users to input specific preferences for the floor plan layout.
- **Realistic Output:** Generates high-quality 2D floor plans that closely resemble actual architectural designs.
- **Efficient Workflow:** Streamlines the design process for architects, interior designers, and researchers by quickly providing multiple layout options.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the FloorPlanGAN model, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `genAPI` folder:
   ```bash
   cd genAPI
   ```

2. Set up the paths for the required model files:
   - `model_10.h5`
   - `g_model.h5`

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
